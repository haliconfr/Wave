Android Vine app remake

Needs a Google Firebase and Firestore account to run.

Features:

- Fully functional user profiles including biographies, editable profile photos and video gallery.

- Videos include the username of the uploader, any tags the uploader set and a description of the video.

- The ability to record and upload videos using the phone's camera. Very similar to how Vine's camera worked, recording multiple videos and splicing them together.

- Animated like button/camera recording button

- The ability to like/unlike videos, changing a live counter under the video's display.

- Tapping the user's name on videos loads their profile.

- Fully functional login screen making it easy for users to create and login to accounts using their username, email and password.

- The ability to follow users

- A trending page showing the most liked videos uploaded
-
- A following page showing recent videos from followed users

Only works on android phones using SDK version 30 because of newer version's camera limitations.
Feel free to use any code/visual assets for anything! no need for credit :)
